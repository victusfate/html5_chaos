my small contribution is simply learning how to translate these effects in coffeescript so I can more easily read and understand them.   
Even that effort is mostly the work of <a href="http://ricostacruz.com/js2coffee/">js2coffee</a> (with generous 2 space replacements with tabs)  
it didn't quite start up after conversion without inspecting the element.
